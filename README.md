# Godot Sandbox Programs

This repository can be used as a starting point for automatically building and maintaining Sandbox programs with CMake. These programs are for use with the [Godot Sandbox](https://github.com/libriscv/godot-sandbox).

All programs are built in CI using a modern C/C++ RISC-V toolchain, with access to the Godot Sandbox C++ API, and automatically zipped and uploaded to a Draft release. Fork this repository and build your own Sandbox programs in a maintainable way!


## Usage

If you are using Godot Sandbox, each program built by this repository can be downloaded by a Sandbox node using `Sandbox.download_program(name)`. See the READMEs of each program for how to use.

## Example programs

### Hello World

The [Hello World example](/programs/hello-world) is a minimal project that can be used as a starting point for anyone who wants to write Sandbox programs using modern C++.

### Asm JIT example

A [RISC-V assembler](/programs/asm) is embedded into a Sandbox program. It will assemble RISC-V and return a callable.

### LuaJit example

[LuaJit is embedded](/programs/luajit) into a Sandbox program. It can be used to run JIT-compiled Lua at run-time.

### libtcc example

[Libtcc is embedded](/programs/libtcc) into a Sandbox program. It can be used to compile and run C-code at run-time.

### Mir example

[Mir is embedded](/programs/mir) into a Sandbox program. It can be used to compile and run C-code at run-time.
